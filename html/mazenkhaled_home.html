            CrossfireX is a first-person shooter and the console version of CrossFire (2007). The free-to-play multiplayer component is similar to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, which sees two opposing teams, representing two hostile private military factions,
            compete in game modes to complete objectives. Classic mode sees the attacking team attempting to plant a bomb while the defending team has to stop them. All players are equipped with standard weapons. The Spectre mode is a variation of the
            classic mode, though the attacking players are spectres, who are only equipped with knives but they can stay invisible when they are not moving.[2] There is also a Modern mode, in which the two teams need to fight for maintaining control over
            two objective points in a map.[3] The single-player portion, which is also found on Crossfire HD on PC in China, which would not be free-to-play, consists of several operations. Each operation includes several episodes. At launch, there would
            be two operations available. The story explores a global conflict between Black List and Global Risk, two private military factions.[4]

            The original Crossfire, developed by Smilegate Entertainment, is an extremely popular free-to-play multiplayer game for personal computers in the East. The team wanted to expand the narrative of the franchise and introduce it to a broader audience. Therefore,
            the team partnered with Microsoft to create a console version and entrusted Remedy Entertainment, a Finnish video game developer, to create a single-player campaign for the game, alongside a PC version of the campaign for Crossfire HD in China.[5]
            As Remedy at that time was exploring the idea of working on a first-person shooter, and planned on developing multiple projects at once, the team agreed to help Smilegate.[6] Remedy had been working on the single-player portion since 2016.[7]
            The single-player portion will be powered by Remedy's own Northlight engine, which was used previously in Quantum Break and Control. Remedy was chosen due to the team's expertise in creating memorable fictional worlds and characters. Inspired
            by Metal Gear Solid and Resident Evil, the team hoped to create characters that are "larger-than-life
